# Roman-Numeral-Converter-repo
A Roman Numeral Converter project translates numeric values into Roman numeral notation, facilitating the conversion between modern numbers and their Roman equivalents.

This project allows users to input decimal numbers and receive their corresponding representation in Roman numerals. It handles the conversion process following the rules of Roman numeral notation, including symbols like 'I' for 1, 'V' for 5, 'X' for 10, 'L' for 50, 'C' for 100, 'D' for 500, and 'M' for 1000. The project may involve algorithms to determine the appropriate Roman numeral representation for each decimal value, considering rules such as subtraction notation and maximum repeatable symbols.
